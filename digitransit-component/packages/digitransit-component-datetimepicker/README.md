## Datetimepicker

This component renders an input to choose a date and time. Renders separate input fields for date and time selection. Values for timestamp and arriveBy correspond to Digitransit query params time and arriveBy. This component will display a native date input on mobile and a custom one for desktop. Mobile detection is done by parsing user agent.

### Parameters

    -   `props.realtime` **[boolean][2]** Determine if selected time should be updated in realtime when 'now' is selected.
    -   `props.initialArriveBy` **[boolean][2]** Initial value for arriveBy. Determines if picker is in arrival mode (true) or departure mode (false). Correct value is kept in component state even if this is not updated. Changing this will also trigger change in the component.
    -   `props.initialTimestamp` **[Number][3]** Initial value for selected time. Unix timestamp in seconds. Updating this will change timepicker value but the correct value is kept in component state even if this is not updated.
